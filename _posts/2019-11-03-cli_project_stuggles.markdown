The last 2 weeks have been honestly horrible for my home life. Of course it happens at the worst possible time...when i've got a ton of work and a large project on top of the pile. It feels like I was making strides towards finishing for a while. The menu worked beautifully and, while I'm sure it isn't that impressive or complex, I was proud to have gotten it working and looking like it did. After that though... 

The idea was to make a CLI that would allow you to select a preferred movie genre and follow that down the rabbit hole of menus to a movie playing currently, showtimes for it, and take you to where you can buy tickets. As I said the command console portion worked like a dream... until I tried to go one level deeper. Whenever I tried to connect the movie choices to it I was bombarded with errors, one I had never seen before. *SystemStackError: stack level too deep. * 

I pounded away at this project until my time just ran out. I don't like to give up but I'm at a standstill right now and I hope that when I review this with an instructor they give me a "Oh you were close you just needed this.." but honestly I feel like I missed entire chunks of code. I'm disappointed in myself but not entirely surprised as time was against me and I had to skip entire sections to work on this.
