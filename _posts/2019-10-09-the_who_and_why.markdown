My name is Patrick and i'm a 27 year old guy from Maryland. I graduated high school in 2010 and attended college at Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina. During my time there I bounced from major to major trying to find a fit. I ended up working in a small family owned BBQ restaurant where I fell in love with cooking. From there I ended up at a minor league baseball stadium. My third year there I was named head chef and handled all the weddings, banquets, buffets, proms and everything in between. Unfortunately, love only gets you so far as my body was struggling to keep up with what it needed to do. Long days of never sitting down and running all over the place for barely enough money to survive on catches up with you eventually.

I've always been a nerd. I spend a lot of time (probably too much) on my computer. Programming seemed like it would be a perfect fit for me. I even live near a military base that is in constant need of people with programming experience. So with that in mind I made the leap from the kitchen to the world of computers. 

So far I haven't struggled horribly. There were a few times, though, where I stared at the blank sheet for what felt like an eternity screaming internally "WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO EVEN DO HERE?" The resources are there, the people are there, the whole freaking internet is there. Try not to overthink the problem. Take it one step at a time and follow the errors. That's the best piece of advice i've learned here...to follow the errors. That Prime? Lab did make me pull my hair out though...
